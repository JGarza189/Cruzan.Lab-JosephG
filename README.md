# Joseph Garza – Ten Thousand Oaks Project

This repository serves as a hub for data management, analyses, and project documentation for work on the Ten Thousand Oaks Project with Professor Mitch Cruzan at Portland State University.  

The project focuses on the genetic and demographic health of Oregon White Oak (*Quercus garryana*) across its range. It investigates standing genomic variation, somatic mutations, and phenotypic plasticity, and explores strategies for understanding local and arid-adapted genotypes to support population resilience under climate change.

**Advisor:** Dr. Mitch Cruzan  
**Graduate Student Candidate:** Joseph Garza (2025–Present)
