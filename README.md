## About the Lab

The Cruzan Lab utilizes ecological and molecular genetic techniques to address questions in plant ecology and evolutionary biology. Research interests include:  

- Evolutionary consequences of somatic mutation accumulation and developmental selection in plants  
- Hybridization, invasive species, phylogeography, and dispersal  
- Landscape genetics and dispersal of upland prairie plants in Southern Oregon  
- Dispersal, range expansion, and adaptation of invasive grasses in the Pacific Northwest

## The Ten Thousand Oaks Project

The **Ten Thousand Oaks Project** is a collective effort led by Portland State University to assess the genetic and demographic health of the Oregon White Oak (*Quercus garryana var. garryana*) across its range.  

### Goals
1. Understand the origins of oak populations in the Pacific Northwest  
2. Identify populations most susceptible to decline due to climate change  
3. Locate source populations for genetic remediation of vulnerable populations  

### Approach
- Integrates ecological, genetic, geographic, climate, and paleontological data  
- Utilizes bioinformatics, phylogeography, landscape genetics, ecological niche modeling, and GIS analyses  
- Combines demographic sampling and genetic analyses across the species range (southern British Columbia to Northern California)  
- Implements controlled pollination to create admixed acorns combining local adaptive variation with genotypes from arid-adapted populations  
- Monitors hybrid and pure acorns in trial plantings to assess survival and inform remediation strategies  

The project aims to maintain the long-term sustainability of Oregon White Oak populations while leveraging local adaptive genetic variation for resilience against climate change.
