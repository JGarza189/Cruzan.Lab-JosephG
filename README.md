# Ten Thousand Oaks Project – Joseph Garza

This private repository serves as the hub for internal data management, analyses, and project documentation for my work on the Ten Thousand Oaks Project with Professor Mitch Cruzan at Portland State University.  

The project focuses on the genetic and demographic health of Oregon White Oak (*Quercus garryana var. garryana*) across its range. It investigates standing genomic variation, somatic mutations, and phenotypic plasticity, and explores strategies for admixture of local and arid-adapted genotypes to support population resilience under climate change.
