## Project Overview

This repository contains my work on the **Ten Thousand Oaks Project**, focusing on the genetic and demographic health of Oregon White Oak (*Quercus garryana var. garryana*).  

### Research Goals
- Investigate standing genomic variation, somatic mutations, and phenotypic plasticity  
- Identify populations vulnerable to climate change  
- Explore admixture strategies combining local and arid-adapted genotypes for restoration  

### Approach
- Collect and analyze ecological, genetic, and geographic data  
- Use bioinformatics pipelines, phylogeography, landscape genetics, and GIS analyses  
- Conduct controlled pollination experiments to generate hybrid and pure acorns  
- Monitor trial plantings for survival and long-term performance
