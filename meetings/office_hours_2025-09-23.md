# Meeting Notes | Research Ideas with Dr. Cruz #

- Explore whether we can identify different branches of a tree that carry somatic mutations.

- Investigate somatic mutation in plants and how this connects to concepts like genomic offsets and drought adaptation.

# Experimental idea: #

- Collect seedlings from a single population.

- Grow subsets under high-drought and well-watered conditions.

- Measure morphological and physiological traits.

# Aim: #

- Determine how much of drought adaptation is due to genetic differences vs. phenotypic plasticity.

- Use whole-genome sequencing and GBS (genotyping-by-sequencing) for analysis.

# Other #

- Sequence 96 samples to capture about 4,000 loci.

- Consider connections to the Botanical Society of America for collaboration, presentation, or funding opportunities.
